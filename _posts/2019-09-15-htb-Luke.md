This week we are taking a look at the retired Hack The Box machine [Luke](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/190) (Medium difficulty)

Starting off with our nmap scans:
```

Straight away we have ftp open with anonymous access, so taking a quick look if there is anything there:
```
root@kali: ftp 10.10.10.137

```

We also try to upload a file but do not have permissions. Looking at the file we read a note from the developer:
```
root@kali: cat for_Chihiro.txt
Dear Chihiro !!

As you told me that you wanted to learn Web Development and Frontend, I can give you a little push by showing the sources of 
the actual website I've created .
Normally you should know where to look but hurry up because I will delete them soon because of our security policies ! 

Derry 
```
Looks like the website will be our next best bet!

Browsing over to http://10.10.10.137 we are presented with a pretty basic single page website that doesnâ€™t have a lot in terms of functionality.. but we know something is here because the note told us.

Next steps is to enumerate the server using gobuster to see if there are any hidden directories or files that might help us:
```
root@kali: gobuster -t 50 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster-x.log -u http://10.10.10.137 -x html,php,txt

```

`/member` returns an empty directory listing page (so we know that the server has directory listing enabled) login.php opens up a login page.. but we have no credentials yet. Finally `config.php` has something very interesting for us:
```
root@kali: cat config.php
$dbHost = 'localhost';
$dbUsername = 'root';
$dbPassword  = 'Zk6heYCyv6ZE9Xcg';
$db = "login";

$conn = new mysqli($dbHost, $dbUsername, $dbPassword,$db) or die("Connect failed: %s\n". $conn -> error);
```
We have some database credentials for the login database. We try the password and a few common usernames against the `login.php` but are not able to get in, so we continue digging.

Moving on to the next website on port 3000 we see that nmap has identified it as a Nodejs Express service. Hitting the site in a browser returns a response that we do not have an auth token:

![658cf41c-5ac5-4aeb-a839-9e74c9829c72.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Luke/658cf41c-5ac5-4aeb-a839-9e74c9829c72.png)


But there has to be a way to get an auth token so we go back to our friend gobuster:
```
root@kali: gobuster -t 50 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -o gobuster-3000.log -u http://10.10.10.137:3000

```

We know that this is a nodejs Express api so there is no need to test file extensions.

`/users` returns the same error message, but `/login` looks like what we want. Reading up on how Express authenticates, we see that there are 2 likely options, Basic auth and Bearer auth using JWT tokens. 

We try some GET connections adding Authorization: Basic and Authorization: Bearer with various combinations of usernames, but no change. It is time to see what other HTTP methods the endpoint allows by sending an OPTIONS request.

![34e4d824-9eb1-4fe0-8547-439133e9cb9c.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Luke/34e4d824-9eb1-4fe0-8547-439133e9cb9c.png)

We see that the endpoint allows us to send POST requests, so we go through the motions of creating some json requests until eventually we get a hit:
```

```
Because we have been playing with JWT tokens we should almost instantly recognise the response token as a JWT that we can add to our request headers for the other endpoints:
```

[{"ID":"1","name":"Admin","Role":"Superuser"},{"ID":"2","name":"Derry","Role":"Web Admin"},{"ID":"3","name":"Yuri","Role":"Beta Tester"},{"ID":"4","name":"Dory","Role":"Supporter"}]
```
Note that here we are adding the token from the /login response as an `Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]` and we get a response listing out all the users.

With a development background and someone that is familiar with APIs and routing it was worth trying the user ids in the url. Generally REST APIs use routing and the request method to help decide what to do. Routing works by taking arguments from the URL such as /users/[userid] where userid will then be used by the application to perform a task against that id.

so we try to browse directly to something like /users/1 with the authentication token still in the headers. We get a 404 not found, but if we use the name field instead of the id field we begin to get some results:
```
Request: 
GET /users/admin HTTP/1.1

{"name":"Admin","password":"WX5b7)>/rp$U)FW"}
```
Following the same format for all the users initially returned we end up with the following list of credentials:
```
{"name":"Admin","password":"WX5b7)>/rp$U)FW"}
{"name":"Derry","password":"rZ86wwLvx7jUxtch"}
{"name":"Yuri","password":"bet@tester87"}
{"name":"Dory","password":"5y:!xa=ybfe)/QD"}
```
Interestingly the admin password returned is different to the one we used to authenticate.

At this point it took a moment to figure out next steps.. the credentials did not work on any of the login screens we have encountered so far, nor did they work against SSH or FTP. So we went back to the drawing board and re-scanned the website, this time trying a new tool called erodir (https://github.com/PinkP4nther/EroDir)

By default EroDir happens to include 401 responses as a valid response code which leads us to a folder we had not seen yet:
```

```

Hitting `/management` prompts us for Basic Auth, finally we are able to use `Derry:rZ86wwLvx7jUxtch` to log in.

We are presented with 3 files. config.php looks to be the same as the one we have already seen, login.php provides a different login page to the previous one and config.json shares some interesting information about the Ajenti software installed on port 8000.
```
config.json:

{
    "users": {
        "root": {
            "configs": {

                "ajenti.plugins.munin.client.MuninClient": "{\"username\": \"username\", \"prefix\": \"http://localhost:8080/munin\", \"password\": \"123\"}",

                "ajenti.plugins.ajenti_org.main.AjentiOrgReporter": "{\"key\": null}", 
                "ajenti.plugins.logs.main.Logs": "{\"root\": \"/var/log\"}", 
                "ajenti.plugins.mysql.api.MySQLDB": "{\"password\": \"\", \"user\": \"root\", \"hostname\": \"localhost\"}", 
                "ajenti.plugins.fm.fm.FileManager": "{\"root\": \"/\"}", 
                "ajenti.plugins.tasks.manager.TaskManager": "{\"task_definitions\": []}", 
                "ajenti.users.UserManager": "{\"sync-provider\": \"\"}", 
                "ajenti.usersync.adsync.ActiveDirectorySyncProvider": "{\"domain\": \"DOMAIN\", \"password\": \"\", \"user\": \"Administrator\", \"base\": \"cn=Users,dc=DOMAIN\", \"address\": \"localhost\"}", 
                "ajenti.plugins.elements.usermgr.ElementsUserManager": "{\"groups\": []}", 
                "ajenti.plugins.elements.projects.main.ElementsProjectManager": "{\"projects\": \"KGxwMQou\\n\"}"
            }, 
            "password": "KpMasng6S5EtTy9Z", 
            "permissions": []
        }
    }, 
    "language": "", 
    "bind": {
        "host": "0.0.0.0", 
        "port": 8000
    }, 
    "enable_feedback": true, 
    "ssl": {
        "enable": false, 
        "certificate_path": ""
    }, 
    "authentication": true, 
    "installation_id": 12354
}
```

Straight away we have a password in plain text. we try the combination  `root:KpMasng6S5EtTy9Z` against the login form on port 8000 and get in.

Ajenti is a server management tool and on the left hand side we see a terminal option. Clicking this brings up a page of existing terminals, if none exist from previous users create a new one. We get dumped straight into  a root shell and can read the `/root/root.txt` as well as the `/home/derry/user.txt` flags.
